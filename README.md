## Variants
srabbit 604 has different variants, each serves different purposes. srabbit 604 (the base model) consists 4S 2P 6000mAh 18650 cells, which makes it easy to build. While srabbit 604+ contains 4S (1P) 8000mAh Lithium-polymer cells which to us thinking it is difficult to source with the exact match.

The USB brick allows srabbit 604 to charge the devices, while the tablet chargers / holders (the X and XG series) can not only charge tablets, they can let tablets stay uninterrupted off-grid for about a day.

These modular batteries and power bricks are partially released, other variants and ranges will be released once it is done designing / prototyping and testing.
