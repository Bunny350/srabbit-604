## Variants
srabbit 604 has different variants, each serves different purposes. srabbit 604 (the base model) consists 4S 2P 6000mAh 18650 cells, which makes it easy to build. While srabbit 604+ contains 4S (1P) 8000mAh Lithium-polymer cells which to us thinking it is difficult to source with the exact match.

The USB brick allows srabbit 604 to charge the devices. In the future, the tablet chargers / holders (the X and XG series) can not only charge tablets, they can let tablets stay uninterrupted off-grid for about a day (or otherwise less).

These modular batteries and power bricks are open for early access. Accessories will be released once it is done designing, prototyping and testing.
