# Contributing guidelines
This guideline allows you to modify the product properly, which is needed to make sure the product ecosystem must not be damaged.

To modify the project properly, you must download at least it's CAD file, it is located in CAD Files folder. This makes sure it is properly shaped, especially curves.

## To do and not to do
The following guidelines which must be met:
* For the bottom shell assembly, remember that it's walls must be at least 2mm, or at best 3mm.

* If you are modifying the existing battery brick, please avoid removing official assets.
* Keep the BMS in place, or make sure the srabbit 604 battery isn't as thin as a smartphone.

For the first-time contributor of this repository (but not in battery building), this battery must be:
* Rapidly producible for personal or relations / Easily built with common materials (PETG or ABS), mostly for 3D printing,
* runs in 4S 14.8V (series) and up to 4P (parallel).

Any contributions that may not meet our requirements may be repaired or fixed by the officials.
